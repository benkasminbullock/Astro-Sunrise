Most remaining issues have been dealt with in version 0.93. Yet,
two issues will need to be addressed in some next version.

1) Check the "precise" algorithm.

2) Improve code coverage in module checks.
In other words, play the Devel::Cover game.

3) Play the CPANTS game.

But remember that this is not an end in itself. It is just a mean
(kwalitee checking) towards an end (quality). For example, the module
did not get the points for the LICENSE POD paragraph. Yet, there is a
LICENSE POD paragraph. Just the automated CPANTS check did not
recognize its contents. But any human reader will admit the paragraph
is correct. So this is a kwalitee issue I will not fix. And I will
not complain to the authors of the programs that power the CPANTS
site. I have better things to do and they have better things to do.
